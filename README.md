Reading, manipulating and analyzing audio files (.wav) in MATLAB

# Project Task

# A
Three audio signals are provided to you (bass.wav, drums.wav and guitar.wav).
 Extract a segment from each audio signals (from 10th second to 20th second of each audio signal). Listen to each signal.
 After step 2, combine all the three signals and listen to the final audio signal.
 Increase the bass part of the signal (obtained in step 3) to 3 times. Listen to the audio and see the difference.
 Gradually increase the amplitude of the drums in the audio signal obtained in step 3. Listen to the audio obtained.
 Create a stereo audio signal by combining all the three audio signals given in step 1.

# C
Five speech signals are provided to you (one.wav, two.wav, three.wav, four.wav and five.wav). Recognize the given test/unknown speech signal (test.wav and test2.wav) using correlation concept.
